      'Macworld Steve Jobs unveiled the CEO of Apple unveiled the iPhone. The iPhone would go on to change the way we communicate.',
    summary:
      "Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997. When he returned, the company was teetering close to bankruptcy. One of his first accomplishments to buy time was to convince his old friend and competitor Bill Gates to invest in Apple and announce that Microsoft was committed to keeping its forward on the Macintosh. He also immediately set out to streamline Apple's product line and begin work on new products. The first of the new products was the all in one colorful Imac’s. They were a success and provided Apple with the breathing room to develop new products.In October 2001 Apple introduced the iPod. The first version could hold 1,000 songs and was considered a breakthrough in music devices. Apple began secretly working on combining a music player with a phone. On January 9th at the annual Macworld show in San Francisco Steve got on stage and unveiled the for the first time the iPhone. On the 12th anniversary of that event the then Wall Street Journal tech editors Walt Mossberg tweeted: “The unveiling of the iPhone was a seminal event in the history of technology. I’ll never forget it. So glad I left the Consumer Electronics Show in 2007 to fly to SF to attend. Jobs convinced me to do so without telling me the product. ‘Walt, this will be as big as the Mac.’”.While the initial iPhone did not support third-party apps, Steve Jobs recognized the mistake and a year later the phone was opened up to third-party apps, that soon changed the world of communication and computing. Millions of Apps were developed for the iPhone and its' iOS operating system. Millions of users soon had a computer in their pocket. The iPhone drove Apple to unprecedented growth and profitability. Its main competitor became phones using an operating system developed by Google called Android.",

    summary:
      "On May 2, 2011 an elite American military unit entered the compound were Osama Bin Laden was hiding in Abbottabad Pakistan. Once there they engaged in a brief fire fight and then shot Osama bin Laden. The attacking force made up of 25 Navy Seals and other commandos returned to their helicopters with the Bin Laden's body, other people captured at the compound and documents and computers.The death of Bin Laden ended one of the longest manhunts in American history that had begun when Bin Laden had ordered the attack on the US Destroyer Cole in 2000. That manhunt became US priority number on after the destruction of the Twin Tower in New York on 9/11. Bin Laden was almost captured in the mountain region of Tor Bora I Afghanistan after the US intervention there in late 2001. The trail went cold soon after and repeated attempts to find him failed.When the Obama administration began President Obama ordered intelligence assets moved from Iraq to Afghanistan to reinvigorate the hunt. Thanks to a number of intelligence breakthroughs it became clear the Bin Laden was likely to be hiding in the compound in Abbottabad. President Obama and his national security team met a number of times and eventually gave the green light for the mission under the auspices of the Central Intelligence Agency.",

    summary:
      'When the United States retired the Space Shuttle, it lost its only launching method for human-crewed flight. For nine years, the U.S. had to rely on Russian launch vehicles to send astronauts into space. Space X, which had been founded in 2002 by Elon Musk to lower the cost of space travel, had developed a reusable launch vehicle called the Falcon 9 and a crew rated spacecraft called Dragon 2. Space-X was under contract with NASA to fly cargo resupply missions to the Intneratnaion Space Station. As of the summer of 2020, it had launched 20 uncrewed missions successfully to the I.S.S.The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 had allocated $1.3 Billion for the Commercial Crew Development Program. Four companies received money to develop spacecraft to shuttle astronauts to the I.S.S under terms of the program. Boeing and Space X were the only ones to receive full funding for the project. Space X received a $2.6 Billion allocation, and the Boeing received $4.2 Billion. The Space X Dragon has a 390 Cubic foot pressurized cabin and can accommodate up to seven astronauts.After several unmanned tests, Space-X was ready first to launch a human-crewed mission. On May 30, 2020, Douglas Hurley and Robert Behnken became the first NASA astronauts to be launched on a privately built spacecraft. The mission was launched from Complex 39A of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The space capture was renamed Endeavor. The next day on May 31, Endeavor successfully docked with the I.S.S.On August 2, 2020, Endeavor undocked and made a successful reentry and splash-down in the Gulf of Mexico.',

    summary:
      'In a referendum held on May 21, 2006, 55.5 percent of Montenegrins (just over the necessary threshold of 55 percent) voted to end the federation of Serbia and Montenegro. On June 3, 2006, Montenegro declared its independence, which was recognized by the Serbian parliament two days later.The principal feature of the first years of independence was the economic boom of 2006–08, with growth rates exceeding 6 percent each year. The boom was followed, however, by a contraction of roughly the same percentage in 2009. Sharp declines in European bank credit, real estate sales (to Russians in particular), and direct foreign investment—factors that had been partly responsible for the boom—accounted for the economic retreat.',

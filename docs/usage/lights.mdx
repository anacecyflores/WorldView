# Lights

`react-globe` uses two light sources to illuminate the globe. The colors and intensity of the light sources can be configured using various light options.

## Ambient Light

The [ambient light](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/AmbientLight) illuminates all objects in the scene equally. Use the playground code editor to play around with the respective ambient light options.

<Playground>
  <ReactGlobe
    options={{
      ambientLightColor: 'red',
      ambientLightIntensity: 1,
    }}
  />
</Playground>

## Point Light

The [point light](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/PointLight) provides a source of light emitting from a single point. Use the playground code editor to play around with the respective ambient light options

<Playground>
  <ReactGlobe
    options={{
      pointLightColor: 'orange',
      pointLightIntensity: 4,
      pointLightPositionRadiusScales: [2, 1, -1],
    }}
  />
</Playground>

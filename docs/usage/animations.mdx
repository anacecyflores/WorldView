# Animations

`react-globe` provides a simple way to execute globe animations through a series of steps. Simply pass an array of animation steps to the `animations` prop and `react-globe` will sequentially execute the animations.

Animations are executed using the focus mechanism and therefore each animation requires specifying the `coordinates`, `focusAnimationDuration`, `focusDistanceRadiusScale` and `focusEasingFunction`.

When the globe is animating, it is locked and all interactions are disabled until the animation sequence is completed.

A partnership was formed and they collaborated until Niépce's death in 1833, after which Daguerre continued their work for the next six years.

With the discovery of fission in 1939, it became clear to scientists that certain radioactive materials could be used to make a bomb of unprecented power. U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt responded by creating the Uranium Committee to investigate this possibility. Progress was slow until Aug., 1942, when the project was placed under U.S. Army control and reorganized. The Manhattan Engineer District (MED) was the official name of the project. The MED's commanding officer, Gen. Leslie R. Groves, was given almost unlimited powers to call upon the military, industrial, and scientific resources of the nation.A $2-billion effort was required to obtain sufficient amounts of the two necessary isotopes, uranium-235 and plutonium-239. At Oak Ridge, Tenn., the desired uranium-235 was separated from the much more abundant uranium-238 by a laborious process called gaseous diffusion. At the Hanford installation (Wash.), huge nuclear reactors were built to transmute nonfissionable uranium-238 into plutonium-239. This method was based on the principle of the self-sustaining nuclear reaction (nuclear pile) that had first been achieved under the leadership of Enrico Fermi at the metallurgical laboratory of the Univ. of Chicago.

He also immediately set out to streamline Apple's product line and begin work on new products. The first of the new products was the all in one colorful Imac’s. They were a success and provided Apple with the breathing room to develop new products.In October 2001 Apple introduced the iPod. The first version could hold 1,000 songs and was considered a breakthrough in music devices. Apple began secretly working on combining a music player with a phone. On January 9th at the annual Macworld show in San Francisco Steve got on stage and unveiled the for the first time the iPhone. On the 12th anniversary of that event the then Wall Street Journal tech editors Walt Mossberg tweeted: “The unveiling of the iPhone was a seminal event in the history of technology. I’ll never forget it. So glad I left the Consumer Electronics Show in 2007 to fly to SF to attend. Jobs convinced me to do so without telling me the product. ‘Walt, this will be as big as the Mac.’”.While the initial iPhone did not support third-party apps, Steve Jobs recognized the mistake and a year later the phone was opened up to third-party apps, that soon changed the world of communication and computing. Millions of Apps were developed for the iPhone and its' iOS operating system. Millions of users soon had a computer in their pocket. The iPhone drove Apple to unprecedented growth and profitability. Its main competitor became phones using an operating system developed by Google called Android.",

Four companies received money to develop spacecraft to shuttle astronauts to the I.S.S under terms of the program. Boeing and Space X were the only ones to receive full funding for the project. Space X received a $2.6 Billion allocation, and the Boeing received $4.2 Billion. The Space X Dragon has a 390 Cubic foot pressurized cabin and can accommodate up to seven astronauts.After several unmanned tests, Space-X was ready first to launch a human-crewed mission. On May 30, 2020, Douglas Hurley and Robert Behnken became the first NASA astronauts to be launched on a privately built spacecraft. The mission was launched from Complex 39A of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The space capture was renamed Endeavor. The next day on May 31, Endeavor successfully docked with the I.S.S.On August 2, 2020, Endeavor undocked and made a successful reentry and splash-down in the Gulf of Mexico.",

    "summary": "In a referendum held on May 21, 2006, 55.5 percent of Montenegrins (just over the necessary threshold of 55 percent) voted to end the federation of Serbia and Montenegro. On June 3, 2006, Montenegro declared its independence, which was recognized by the Serbian parliament two days later.The principal feature of the first years of independence was the economic boom of 2006–08, with growth rates exceeding 6 percent each year. The boom was followed, however, by a contraction of roughly the same percentage in 2009. Sharp declines in European bank credit, real estate sales (to Russians in particular), and direct foreign investment—factors that had been partly responsible for the boom—accounted for the economic retreat.",

The gathering was officially to announce the date of the canonisation of 800 Catholic martyrs, Antonio Primaldo and companions, and the Latin American nuns Laura Montoya Upegui and Maria Guadalupe Garcia Zavala. At the ceremony, known as the Consistory for the canonization of the martyrs of Otranto, he told those present that he had made a decision of great importance for the life of the church. In a statement, he cited his deteriorating strength due to old age and the physical and mental demands of the papacy.He also declared that he would continue to serve the Church through a life dedicated to prayer.Two days later, he presided over his final public Mass, Ash Wednesday services that ended with congregants bursting into a deafening standing ovation that lasted for minutes while the pontiff departed St. Peter's Basilica. On 17 February 2013, Benedict, speaking in Spanish, requested prayers for himself and the new pope from the crowd in St. Peter's Square.",
